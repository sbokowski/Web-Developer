#       git object types
 
       Different git objext types 
     2 main objects types   
        1. Files 
         2. Folders 

       Blob    /  represent fles , files files files

       Tree   /  represent folder or directories folders or directories

       Commit   /.  pointers to specific trees  pointer to specific trees
           -you can create different commits 

        Annotated tag  /  Annotated tags are stored as full objects 
      in the Git database. To reiterate, They store extra meta data 
        such as: the tagger name, email, and date. Similar to commits
        and commit messages Annotated tags have a tagging message.

   #          Hashes of the Git objects 
  
              Hash is create using specific hash function namely sha
     hash function and hash functions create 

                 Variable length  input 
                            
                Any variable length input

                  Hash function

                 Fixed length hash  ( see above )

               Hexadecimal 16 characters (12345 , ABCCD )
               
               Decimal 10 characters (0.1234565)
    
                 Binary 2 characters (0, 1)

                       
                                            SHA 1
                
             	              	        160 bits

                                  40 hexadecimal  characters

    Now , lets’ proceed and lets create first file in our Git  repository
      It our working direectory folder 
                                    

          In Git there are 3 areas  in Git 

         1        Working directory 

         2   	Staging area / index

        3 	      Git repository 


            And there is a sub folder called objects you could use tab
       In order to autocomplete this path 

 
         Most common operations 

         Stage
 #      git add  

      Commit 
 #      git commit 

     Jump into certain version of the project
#.     git checkout
      
 
    Lets getting started  , clear screen  or cmmd k

   #                 git add filename.txt

      Use git add to add file to stain are 

    #              git status 

      Now enter git status , now there are changing are
    Some changes to be committed and that means 

  #               git commit -m  “message about commit” 
   
   Now we could use git commit command in order to 
   Commit changes 

      Note commit has a shasum hash assign to it
    Has an id to 
                          
               8a31fb commit 

              Author name / email / 
              commit desciption
               Parent 

       Every commit has author name and email , and works 
     Git works locally. On your computer         

     User name and email config  command 

   #     git config —list 

 #  already set up username and email 
           
#         Git commit. Command

     Now lets go ahead and commit the changes by using cmmd
  Git  commit and this will commit. The changes 

  # git status        - will show status file  - may say new file.txt
 #    -m  means message  must add a message in quotes double
# quotes.  
#       git commit -m “another awesome commit” 

# Git will say of changes made. In commit  1 file changes and 
# name of file and changes
